> "He should put his whole heart into the fight against [difficulties]. If he gives way before them he will lose; if he exerts himself against them he will win. When something is in imminent danger of falling on you, it will only move after you and become an eve greater weight to support if you back away from it. Instead if you stand your ground, willing yourself to resist, it will be forced back. In the same way as the enemy can do far more damage to your army if it is in full retreat, every trouble presses harder on the one who has turned tail and is giving ground."
