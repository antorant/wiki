Accept these feelings. Accept that this is a problem. In accepting it, and embracing it, you can begin to understand.

*Accepting* these feelings, this situation, is not the same as *submitting* to it. You see a solution and you are working towards it, but it will take time and patience.

Be aware of your own pushing and pulling â€” understand the karmic effects of it.
