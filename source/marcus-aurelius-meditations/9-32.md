> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind — things that exist only there — and clear out space for yourself:  
... by comprehending the scale of the world.  
... by contemplating infinite time.  
... by thinking of the speed with which things change — each part of every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.

— Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
