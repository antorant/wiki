> When you have trouble getting out of bed in a morning, remember that your defining characteristic — what defines a human being — is to work with others. Even animals know how to sleep. And it's the characteristic activity that's the more natural one — more innate and more satisfying.

— Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 8:12
