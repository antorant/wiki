# Questions to ask yourself

We find it's not very useful to tell you what you should do. It's far more effective to pose questions when you're contemplating a course of action. We will do this throughout the book. To start with, here are some questions that can help you determine whether polyamory might be a good match for you:

* Have I ever felt romantic love for more than one person at the same time?
* Do I feel there can be only one "true" love or one "real" soulmate?
* How important is my desire for multiple romantic relationships?
* What do I want from my romantic life? Am I open to multiple sexual relationships, romantic relationships, or both? If I want more than one lover, what degree of closeness and intimacy do I expect, and what do I offer?
* How important is transparency to me? If I have more than one lover, am I happy with them knowing about each other? If they have other lovers, am I happy knowing them?
* How do I define commitment? Is it possible for me to commit to more than one person at a time, and if so, what would those commitments look like?
* If I am already in a relationship, does my desire for others come from dissatisfaction or unhappiness with my current relationship? If I were in a relationship that met my needs, would I still want multiple partners?

A great tool for finding, growing and maintaining good relationships is to think about the relationship that you want from the perspective of the people you'd like to attract. The flip side is asking yourself questions about what you're offering them. Some questions that might help:

* What are my needs in relationships? Are they attached to specific people? That is, do I need these things generally, or do I need them just from certain people?

* What configurations am I open to? Am I looking for a particular configuration because I'm afraid that others might be more scary or more threatening?
* Am I flexible in what I'm looking for?
* If my relationship changes, is that okay? Can I accommodate change, even unexpected change or change I don't like?
* When I visualize the kind of relationship I want, how much space does it leave for new partners to shape the relationship to their needs?
* Am I focusing on an idealized fantasy more than on making organic connections with real people?
 * What happens if I connect with someone in a way that differs from how I want my poly relationship to look? What message does that send to someone who doesn't fit neatly into my dreams?

Here are some questions we can ask when making decisions that affect other people, to help guide us toward ethical relationships:

* Have I disclosed all relevant information to everyone affected by my decision?
* Have I sought input from everyone affected? Have I obtained their consent where my decision overlaps their personal boundaries?
* Does my decision impose obligations or expectations on others without their input or consent?
* Am I seeking to have my needs met at the expense of the well-being of others?
* Am I imposing consequences that will make others feel unsafe saying no to me?
* Am I offering others the same consideration that I expect from them?

To become more self-aware and identify your personal strengths, weaknesses and fears—especially as they relate to relationships—here are some questions to consider:

* Why do I have romantic relationships? What do I get out of them?
* What do I consider essential, indispensable elements of a relationship?
* Are there specific kinds of relationships that I know I am looking for? Kinds that
I know I don't want?
* What do I bring to the table for others?
* What makes me feel cherished, loved and secure?
* What makes me afraid in relationships? Why? In what ways do I protect myself from being hurt? Do those strategies help or hinder my search for connection?

When you're thinking about what you want from your relationship life and how you'd like your relationships to be structured, here are some questions it might be useful to ask yourself (and talk over with your partner or partners, if you're in a relationship):

* Why do I have relationships with other people?
* What needs do I have from my partners, in terms of time, emotional availability, commitment, communication and intimacy?
* What does "commitment" mean to me, and why?
* When I think about the future, what does it look like? Is there room for change and growth?
* How much do I value personal autonomy, transparency, cohabitation, having and raising children, shared finances, community, tradition, the opinions of my friends and family, adhering to social norms?
* What values are the most important to me in myself and in others?
* Are the choices I make in alignment with these values?
* Who are my mirrors? Whom do I rely on to call me on my mistakes?
* How do I respond to criticism from people close to me?
* How do I evaluate my choices when the effects of my actions are impossible to predict?
* What do I expect of others, and why?

Communication in relationships, and polyamorous relationships in particular, can be like a proverbial minefield. As you attempt to negotiate this potentially dangerous territory, here are some questions to guide you:

* Do I use words the same way my partners do? Do I often find myself in discussions about the meanings of words?
* If I have a problem with someone's behavior, do I discuss the problem with that person?
* If my partners have a problem with someone else's behavior, do I encourage them to bring it up with that person?
* Do I communicate passively or directly?
* Do I look for hidden meanings in other people's words? Do I bury my real meaning?
* Do I communicate authentically in ways that make me vulnerable?
* In what ways do I actively listen to my partners?

Strategies for better communication include, for starters, active listening, direct communication and nonviolent communication. As you practice these skills on a daily basis in your relationships, here are some questions to keep you on track:

* How directly do I ask for what I want and need?
* What can I do to be more direct in my communication?
* If I hear a hidden meaning in a statement or question, do I ask for clarification before acting on my assumptions?
* Do I perceive criticism in my partner's statements even if they aren't directly critical?
* What do I do to check in with my partners?
* How well do I listen to my partners?
* What do I do to make sure it's safe for my partners to communicate with me, and to let them know it's safe?
 * Does my communication show that I take responsibility for my actions and emotions?

When you've answered the questions below, you can start asking yourself why you feel the way you do. For example, let's say you answer yes to the question "Am I worried that if someone 'better' comes along, my partner will realize I'm not good enough and want to replace me?" That might mean that your self-esteem is not high enough for you to recognize that your partner wants to be with you because he values and cherishes you; some part of you may be thinking, Well, I'm not as good as he thinks I am, so I better keep him away from other people! Otherwise, he'll dump me in a heartbeat. The antidote to those feelings is to build a sense of worthiness and understand what it is about yourself that your partner values. Or say you answer yes to the question "Do I believe that if I am not my partner's only sexual partner, I am not special anymore?" The remedy there is to understand that value in a relationship comes from who you are, not from what you do, so if your partner has the same experience with another person that he has with you, the feeling of that experience is different, because nobody else is you.

* Am I worried that if someone "better" comes along, my partner will realize I'm not good enough and want to replace me?
* Am I uncertain about the value my partner sees in me? Am I not sure why my partner wants to be with me?
* Does the idea of my partner having another lover mean that whatever my partner sees in me will no longer be valid, or that my partner will want to choose that other lover over me?
* Do I feel that most other people are sexier, more good-looking, more worthwhile, funnier, smarter or just generally better than I am, and I am not able to compete with them?
* Do I believe that if I am not jealous, I don't really love my partner?
* Do I think that if my partner falls in love with with another person, he will leave me for that person? Do I think that if my partner has sex with someone "better in bed" than I am, she won't want to have sex with me anymore or won't need me anymore?
* Is sex the glue that holds our relationship together? If my partner has sex with someone else, do I think the relationship will come unglued?
* Do I believe that other people are willing to do sexual things that I'm not willing to do, and therefore my partner will like having sex with them better?
* Am I afraid that if my partner has sex with someone else, she will start comparing me whenever we have sex?
* Am I afraid that anyone my partner has sex with will try to persuade her to leave me?
