Letting go:
* It's not my responsibility to make things better; it's my responsibility to do my best.
* They have limitations too. They may not have the capacity to be different.
* This conflict is not who I am. (Playing a role? Sense of self tied to conflict? why are you fighting?)
* Letting go doesn't mean I no longer care. You can hold on to positive emotions and let go of negative ones. You can learn lessons.
