> "'Don't stare at the tree.' This comes from a biking book. Basically if you're riding (or driving) and you come to a corner a bit faster than you ought to, the bike will travel to where you're looking, ie. the big tree. If you look around the corner, odds on you'll make it round the corner. Applying it to life, if you stare at the shit stuff that could happen then it probably will. Stare at the good stuff."
