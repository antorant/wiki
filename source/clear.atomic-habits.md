## How to create a good habit

### 1. Make it obvious

1.1 Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current
habits to become aware of them.

1.2 Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at
[TIME] in [LOCATION].”

1.3 Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will
[NEW HABIT].”

1.4 Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits
obvious and visible. 

### 2. Make it attractive

2.1 Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do
with an action you need to do.

2.2 Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal
behavior.

2.3 Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy
immediately before a difficult habit. 

### 3. Make it easy

3.1 Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between
you and your good habits.

3.2 Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to
make future actions easier.

3.3 Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices
that deliver outsized impact.

3.4 Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until
they can be done in two minutes or less.

3.5 Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime
purchases that lock in future behavior. 

### 4. Make it satisfying

4.1 Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward
when you complete your habit.

4.2 Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad
habit, design a way to see the benefits.

4.3 Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and
“don’t break the chain.”

4.4 Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure
you get back on track immediately.
